# Introduction

In this project, I have developed a model with an accuracy of 96% and a validation accuracy of 99.67%. It detects the face and gives input to the model. And also it will show "with mask" only if the user wears a mask in the best way. I hope you like this small demo if you want to watch a full tutorial let me know. I'll post full tutorial and also the best way to learn CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) in 2 days.
